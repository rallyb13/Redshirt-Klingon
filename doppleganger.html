    <h2>The Journey</h2>
    <p class="buttonUp"><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780307591081-2">once published</a></p>
    <p class="buttonUp"><a href="http://www.powells.com/staff-top-5s-2013">still an elite reader/recommender</a></p>
    <p>I had a brilliant plan, and it almost worked. I started working at Borders, an easy job to do while pursuing my dream of becoming a published author. Better yet, if I got published, maybe the company would support one of their own. My buddy and I went on a trip around the country correcting typos (his idea), and he kept a blog as we went. After a strange surge of media interest, the blog hits provided evidence of interest to publishers. (Let's pause a moment and reflect on the fact that having a pre-assembled audience is what mattered most to traditional publishing. "And they can write!" was treated as a bonus.)</p>
    <p>Sure enough, Borders stepped up. I was on the internal newsletter. <em>The Great Typo Hunt</em> got front table placement, and Borders stores made up about half of the stops in our 36 city book tour, including the first event at their Columbus Circle location in New York City. Things were going great! Thanks to some great press that happened while we were touring, we hit #84 on Amazon's top sellers (for just an hour, but still). We cracked the 10K mark for books sold, but I was ready for the paperback. That's when this book's fate would be determined. If Borders gave us a couple months on the "Buy 1 Get 1 Half Off" table...</p>
    <p>Alas, within ninety days of our paperback release, Borders announced it was liquidating. I applied to work at Powell's, and in the three years there I'm already making more than I ever did at Borders, maybe having more fun, too. Even so, the plan is kinda over. Whether or not the writing career really works out, I can't just have any old job in the mean time anymore. I need an actual career, one that could be as intellectually engaging as writing, one that I might be able to both enjoy and make money doing. The search narrowed quickly, and I began learning to code. The weird thing is, once I started, I began getting <em>ideas</em>, and I realized there are other ways to tell interesting stories. It's time I got 21st century literate and learned a new medium. I need to crack into coding.</p>
